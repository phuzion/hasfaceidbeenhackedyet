<h3><a href="http://www.bkav.com/d/top-news/-/view_content/content/103968/face-id-beaten-by-mask-not-an-effective-security-measure">Vietnamese cybersecurity firm Bkav has claimed to have done so.</a></h3>

<p>I am unconvinced that Bkav's method for fooling Face ID is practial, 
as they appear to have required extensive 3D scanning of the subject's 
face with cooperation from the subject in question.
<br><br> Additionally, Bkav have done a poor job of clearly answering 
questions from press about critical aspects of their methodology, 
casting doubt on the validity of their claims. For more information 
about this, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/hackers-say-they-broke-apples-face-id-heres-why-were-not-convinced/">please read this article from Ars Technica</a>.</p>
